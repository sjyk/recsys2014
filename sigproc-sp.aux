\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces In many rating systems, participants see aggregate statistics before leaving a rating. The ratings can be affected by Social Influence Bias, where a participant's action is affected by the aggregate statistic they see. We reveal a median rating after a participant has submitted, and test the hypothesis that participants will subsequently regress towards the median, a process called \emph  {Social Herding}.\relax }}{\thepage }}
