% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
Almost all recommender systems display aggregate statistics before participants enter ratings.
These statistics can bias a participant's decision and is known as Social Influence Bias.
We explore this bias in a new platform, the California Report Card (CRC), which reveals the median values to participants after they assign ratings, and allows them to modify their ratings.
We hypothesized that this will lead to revised ratings closer to the revealed median.
We develop a non-parametric significance testing framework based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic to test this hypothesis, and compare our results to a randomized SurveyMonkey survey asking the same questions as the CRC. 
We learn a predictive model relating a participant's initial rating, the observed median, and the rating change, using a polynomial regression technique and Bayesian Information Criterion optimal model search.
Our results suggest statistically significant movement towards the median value for the particpants who changed their ratings.
We learned the optimal polynomial model on ratings for six questions, four of which were modeled with linear functions.
The two remaining questions, about the implementation of Obamacare and Same-sex Marriage Rights in California, were modeled as quadratic functions with significantly higher downward tendency for ratings higher than the median.
We applied the predictive model to infer initial ratings from finals ones and showed that could ``correct" the rating distribution by 76.3\%.
The CRC, our data, and experimental code can be found at:
