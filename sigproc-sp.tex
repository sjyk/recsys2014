% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
User-assigned ratings are a key component of almost all recommender systems.
Many rating systems show participants aggregate statistics from the community before they leave a rating.
These statistics can bias a participant's decision and is part of a broader class of biasing tendencies called Social Influence Bias.
We explore this bias in a new platform, the California Report Card (CRC), which reveals the median values to participants after they assign their own ratings, and then allows them to modify their ratings.
We hypothesized that this will lead to Social Herding, a type of Social Influence Bias, where participants change their ratings towards what they perceive as the norm.
We develop a non-parametric significance testing framework based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic to test this hypothesis, and compare our results to a randomized SurveyMonkey survey asking the same questions as the CRC. 
We also propose a technique to test the relationship between question ordering and Social Influence Bias.
We learn a predictive model relating a participant's initial rating, the observed median, and the rating change, using a polynomal regression technique and Bayesian Information Criterion optimal model search.
Our results suggest statistically significant social herding towards the median value, and participants who changed their ratings were significantly more tightly concentrated around the median.
We learned the optimal polynomial model on ratings for six questions, four of which were modeled with linear functions indicating that homogeneity between a positive and negative social influence.
The two remaining questions, about the implementation of Obamacare and Same-sex Marriage Rights in California, were modeled as quadratic functions with significantly higher downward tendency for ratings higher than the median.
Our results suggest that using a predictive model to correct for the bias resulted in 46.5\% less herding around the median grade.
