% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

\begin{abstract}
The seminal 2003 paper by Cosley, Lab, Albert, Konstan, and Reidl, demonstrated the 
susceptibility of recommender systems to rating biases.  
To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems
display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings.
This effect is called Social Influence Bias (SIB); 
the tendency to conform to the perceived ``norm" in a community.
We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of
SIB in recommender systems.  In the Learning phase,
we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating.  
In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to
test whether the data is consistent with SIB.  
If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression
and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings.
We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a 
rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement.
We found statistically significant evidence of SIB.
Mitigating models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8\% and 
reduce bias by 76.3\%.
The CRC, our data, and experimental code are available at:\\
