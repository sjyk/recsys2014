% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\begin{abstract}
In almost all recommender systems, participants see aggregate statistics, such as a mean or median rating, before they enter a rating of their own.
The bias introduced by the aggregate statistic is known as social influence bias, may encourage participants to conform to what they perceive as the ``norm" in the community.
We explore social influence bias in a new recommender system, the California Report Card (CRC).
The CRC is a two phase recommender system: the first phase collects participant ratings on six political issues to determine the similarity between participants, and a second phase uses the similarity to rank open-ended suggestions in a political discussion.
In this paper, we focus on rating data from the first phase, in which participants see the median value \emph{after} they assign initial ratings, and then have the opportunity to revise their ratings.
We develop a non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic to test the social influence bias hypothesis which accounts for the natural tendency for ratings to concentrate around the median value and that median value changes as more data is collected; concluding a statistically significant bias exists in the CRC.
We also learn a model that predicts a participant's rating change from his or her initial rating using a polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
We show how our polynomial BIC model can be inverted to mitigate the effects of the bias by inferring initial ratings from final ones, and in the CRC, we were able to mitigate the magnitude of the bias by 76.3\%.
The CRC, our data, and experimental code can be found at:\\
